# Fake News Challenge
The [Fake News Challenge](www.fakenewschallenge.org) gives us the following task:

Given 2 articles, classify the relationship between the two articles into the 4 categories: agree, disagree, discuss (neutral), and unrelated.

We use a LSTM network to complete this task, which is created in the file fakenews.py file.

The generate.py file is used to generate answers for the test data.

Note that this version of tensorflow is quite old, and may not be compatible with the most recent version.
