# Fake News Challenge
The [Fake News Challenge](www.fakenewschallenge.org) gives us the following task:

Given 2 articles, classify the relationship between the two articles into the 4 categories: agree, disagree, discuss (neutral), and unrelated.

We use a LSTM network to complete this task.

Note that this version of tensorflow is quite old, and may not be compatible with the most recent version.
